                    My name is Grant Ferment. I was raised in Charlotte, North
                    Carolina and graduated from UNC Charlotte. I graduated with
                    a bachelor's degree in Exercise Science with a Minor in
                    Public Health. I enjoy video games and disc golfing with
                    friends. After I got my degree I was unhappy with
                    working in this field and sought out new job opportunities
                    when I came across web development.
